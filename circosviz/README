This folder contains all scripts needed for Circos analysis of genome assemblies. See "Metagenome assembly guide v. 1.0" for detailed useage.

----- circosviz.pl ----- :

Searches for paired end (PE) reads in a given SAM file and generates overviews of where the PE reads maps to use directly in ciros. An example of the circos configuration file can be found in circosexample/etc/denovoviz.conf and example data output in circosexample/data. An example samfile and genome file can be found in /small.example.dataset. Note that the dataset does not recreate the output data given in /circosexample. 

To run:

perl circosviz.pl -i mygenome.mapping.sam -f mygenome.fa

The following settings can be changed:

[-samfile -i]        SAM formated mapping file
[-fastafile -f]      Fasta file of sequences used in the mapping
[-enddist -e]        Reads must hit within this distance of the end to be considered an end hit (default: 500)
[-minlength -m]      The minimum lenght of a contig to infer closed circle (default: 3000)
[-avgreadlength -a]  The average readlength of the reads used to estimate read position (default: 125)
[-headersplit -s]    The symbol used to split the header to make the read 1 and 2 headers identical (default: _)
[-circoscbin -b]     The windowlength used for the circos coverage file (default: 10000)
[-minpesplit -p]     Minimum distance between PE reads to be considered a split pe read (default: 1000)
[-frc -g]            Add FRCbam Features using the Feature.gff output of FRCbam	 

Outputfiles:

circos.ends.txt           : Connections between PE reads mapping to ends of contigs.    
circos.dcontigs.txt       : Connections between PE reads where atleast one of the PE reads map to different contigs, but where at least one read does not map to the end of a contig.
circos.scontigs.wl.txt    : Connections between PE reads where the reads map within the same contig but not at ends and with a distance greater than the PE distance between them.
circos.karyotype.txt      : Karyotype file need for the basic layout in circos. Contigs are arranged by length and colored using a colorbrewer color scheme. 
circos.coverage.txt       : Contig coverage file that can be used to plot coverage as a data track in circos.
circos.gc.txt             : Contig gc file that can be used to plot gc as a data track in circos.
circos.rules.txt          : Rules file that can be used to color PE connections by the color of their parrent contigs.
circos.count.dcontigs.txt : Contig coverage file of reads mapping on different contigs. The 3 "count" files are usefull for locating regions of the genome where the number of reads mapping are over a given threshold. 
circos.count.ends.txt     : Contig coverage file of reads mapping to ends of different contigs.
circos.count.scontig.txt  : Contig coverage file of reads mapping within the same contig.
frc.tracks.txt            : Reference free validation statistics generated by FRCbam (optional).


The program expects read names to be of the following format:

X_1
X_2

Hence splitting the header by "_" results in the same read name for the paired reads.

E.g the sam file might look as:

@HD	VN:1.0	SO:unsorted
@SQ	SN:contig1	LN:11661
@PG	ID:0	PN:clcgenomicswb	VN:5.0

The folder "/small.example.dataset" contains a small SAM file and fasta file as a testing dataset.

The folder "/circosexample" contains an complete example including configuration files for Circos.
