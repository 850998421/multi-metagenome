----- cytoscapeviz.pl ----- :

Searches for paired end (PE) reads in a given SAM file and generates overviews of where the PE reads maps to use in cytoscape.

To run:

perl cytoscapeviz.pl -i mygenome.mapping.sam -c

The following settings can be changed:

[-infile -i]         SAM format mapping infile
[-outcon -o]         Connections tab file for cytoscape (default: cytoscape.connections.tab)
[-outlen -l]         Contig length tab file for cytoscape (default: cytoscape.length.tab)
[-outcov -u]         Contig coverage tab file for cytoscape (default: cytoscape.coverage.tab)
[-enddist -e]        Reads must hit within this distance of the end to be considered an end hit (default: 500)
[-minlength -m]      The minimum lenght of a contig to infer closed circle (default: 3000)
[-minconnections -f] The minimum number of connections to print the connection to the outfile (default: 10)
[-avgreadlength -a]  The average readlength of the reads used to estimate read position (default: 125)
[-headersplit -s]    The symbol used to split the header to make the read 1 and 2 headers identical (default: _)
[-condensed -c]      Make additional condensed output files with only 1 node per contig.

Outputfiles:

cytoscape.connections.tab  : Load as network file. Indicate connections between two ends of contigs. There are two types of interactions. 0 is used to indicate connection between the start and end of a contig. Start and end of a contig is indicated by addition of "s" or "e" to the contig name. 1 is used to indicate connections between the ends of two different contigs. In addition the number of connections are indicated in column 4.
cytoscape.coverage.tab     : Load as node attribute file. Coverage of all contigs. Used to color nodes (contigs) by their coverage.
cytoscape.length.tab       : Load as node attribute file. Length of all contigs. Used to scale nodes (contigs) by their length.

If the flag -c is added, additional condensed output files with only 1 node per contig is made. Default is 2 nodes per contig (start and end). Otherwise the files are similar to the default output.

condensed.cytoscape.connections.tab
condensed.cytoscape.coverage.tab
condensed.cytoscape.length.tab

The program expects read names to be of the following format:

X_1
X_2

Hence splitting the header by "_" results in the same read name for the paired reads.

E.g the sam file might look as:

@HD	VN:1.0	SO:unsorted
@SQ	SN:contig1	LN:11661
@SQ	SN:contig2	LN:15454
@PG	ID:0	PN:clcgenomicswb	VN:5.0
