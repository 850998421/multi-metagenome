Metagenome R workflow version 1.1
========================================================

## Introduction
This R tutorial show how to extract individual genome bins from metagenomes, as descibed in Albertsen et al., 2013 (Add link). The guide is written in R markdown and can be found [HERE](https://github.com/MadsAlbertsen/multi-metagenome/tree/master/R.data.generation).

The basic requirement is two metagenomes where the target species are in differential abundance. The data is assembled into 1 assembly (i.e a collection of scaffolds). The raw reads are then mapped independently to the assembly, which generates two coverage estimates for each scaffold.

The guide uses the original data from the publication.
