This folder contains scripts to analyze and visualize metagenome assemblies.

circosviz:
Given SAM file of paired-end reads mapped to a set of scaffolds the script indicates connections between scaffolds and produces circos files for visualization.

cytoscapeviz:
Given SAM file of paired-end reads mapped to a set of scaffolds the script indicates connections between scaffolds and produces cytoscape files for visualization.

misc.scripts:
Small scripts used to e.g. calculate kmer frequency of scaffolds.

parse.img.data:
A script used to investigate e.g. phylum level occurance of PFAMs in all available genomes by the use of raw IMG annotations.
